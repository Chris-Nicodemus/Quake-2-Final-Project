Turn Based RPG Mod
This mod transforms the way combat is done in Quake 2. 
Now, whenever a player shoots or is shot by an enemy, it opens a window that represents the setting for the combat.
The turn order is decided by who shoots who first when combat started. For example if the monster shot the player, then the monsters will go first.

Monsters will not automatically attack the player and will only take their turns when the player indicates that they are ready for the new info.
Monsters will act if the player presses the 'G' key on their keyboard, but only if they are in combat and it is the monster's turn to attack.

Players can attack, use skills, or use items on their turn. All of these actions must be input from the console so the game knows whom the player is trying to target.
The player can also run from the combat, if it proves too dangerous for the party at the moment.
When using a skill that targets an enemy, the target will be indicated by typing left, right, or center after the command for the skill or attack.
When in combat, items like potions can only be used on the character whose turn it is. For example, if the hero uses a health potion, they can only use it on themself. Using an item also takes their turn.
Out of combat, the player must specify who they wish to use a potion on. Bombs cannot be used outside of combat.

Finally, there is a shop that can only be accessed while outside of combat where you can purchase better weapons and armor for your party members along with useful items.
There are 3 currencies: Gold, Dragon Scales, and Gun Powder.
Gold is used for most purchases.
Scales are used to buy the strongest weapons and armor.
Gun Powder is used solely to buy bombs for combat.
These resources are rewarded in different amounts based on the type and number of enemies you defeat. 
Be warned, you only get the rewards after defeating ALL of the enemies in a combat. If you run from the combat, you will get nothing!

--Cheats--
'Gold'		Gives you lots of gold.
'Scales'	Gives you lots of scales.
